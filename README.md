## Prerequisites
Node v20.x

## Getting Started
To get this code running on your local machine, run -
1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`

## Technicals
1. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
2. It uses react bootstrap for styling UI elements and theming.
3. It uses react query for caching so that once an API call has already been made, we read it from the cache memory instead of refetching it from the server.

## Future implementation
1. Instead of fetching the first page with 100 items, implement pagination.
2. Add unit test cases.
3. Make the UI more user friendly.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
